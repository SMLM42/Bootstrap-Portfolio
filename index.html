                                My name is Steven Meiers. I was born in Santa Monica and grew up in Brentwood. I
                                attended UCSC, Santa Monica City
                                College and have taken classes using UCLA's extension program. For employment, I
                                have been a private tutor for the last 5-6 years teaching
                                grades K-12 in History, English and Math up to Statistics. Prior to the coding
                                bootcamp at UCLA my only experience
                                coding was self-taught on my graphing calculator writing short programs to minimize
                                the formulas I needed to
                                memorize.

                                            As far as hobbies and interests are concerned, I am an avid gamer, reader,
                                            skier
                                            and traveler. My all-time
                                            favorite game is easily Team Fortress 2 as I have logged almost 4,000 hours.
                                            My
                                            favorite book is the Hitchhikers
                                            Guide to the Galaxy
                                            by Douglas Adams, and I have reread the anthology at least once a year since
                                            I was
                                            12. I have been skiing since I
                                            was 2 and have been to Mammoth Mountain every year since I was born.
                                            Finally, for
                                            travelling I have been fortunate
                                            enough to visit
                                            almost 30 countries, primarily in the Americas, Europe and Asia.
